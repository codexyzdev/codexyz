# Prisma Transactions Skill

This skill provides detailed information and examples for using transactions in Prisma.

## Available Resources

- **Overview**: [overview.md](references/overview.md) - General concepts, ACID properties, and available techniques.
- **Nested Writes**: [nested-writes.md](references/nested-writes.md) - Creating/Updating related records atomically (dependent writes).
- **Batch Operations**: [batch-operations.md](references/batch-operations.md) - Bulk operations like `createMany`, `updateMany`, `deleteMany`.
- **Transaction API**: [transaction-api.md](references/transaction-api.md) - Sequential (`$transaction([])`) and Interactive (`$transaction(fn)`) transactions.
- **Concurrency Patterns**: [concurrency-patterns.md](references/concurrency-patterns.md) - Idempotency and Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC).

## Common Use Cases

1.  **Sequential Operations**: Executing a list of queries in order. See [transaction-api.md](references/transaction-api.md).
2.  **Interactive Transactions**: Using a function to run logic within a transaction. See [transaction-api.md](references/transaction-api.md).
3.  **Nested Writes**: Creating/Updating related records atomically. See [nested-writes.md](references/nested-writes.md).
4.  **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Handling race conditions without locks. See [concurrency-patterns.md](references/concurrency-patterns.md).
